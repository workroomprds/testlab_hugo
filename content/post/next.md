**From James:** I've set up this site because we need one. 
I hope that people who have been involved will update the information here, and change it as they wish.
This is a temporary note. It'll go when we use the site publicly.  a

I imagine that the buttons at the top will go to pages for whatever conference is up and running.

I imagine that we'll make the UI have concertinas for list information so they fold up

I imagine that we'll put some list information into multiple similar markdown docs


We'll need to change everything â€“ text, ordering, colours, technology. But this is a start, and (I hope) a flexible one.
I know that the history is wrong.

I'm using the static-site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io "Hugo :: A fast and modern static website engine").

- the source is in markdown
- the markdown source will be on GitHub so you can change it as you like
- I'll pull everything together and re-upload to testlab.site
