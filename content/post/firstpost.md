It's a space, at a conference, with something to test.

We try to give you working software, a working environment, and working kit – and we try to keep it working (whatever "working" might mean) when you test it. We give you help if you're stuck, build conversations and narratives, sort out your network configuration, laugh with you whe you're surprised, work with you when you're digging in. We use real software with real bugs – and also have a bunch of neat testing toys to play with.

Every TestLab is different, but some people, and some software, are regulars.

You can find regular TestLabs at [EuroSTAR](http://eurostarconferences.com/), STAREast, STARWest, Agile Testing Days and Let's Test. 

# Why?
Because it's good to share skills, and because testers need a target. There's too much talking.
