I think that we need a public page for the TestLab.

So this is the source.

We're using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io "Hugo :: A fast and modern static website engine") to generate a static site from markdown. The markdown files are in "post", the generated html etc. in "public"

The markdown files are under change control, and are kept here. The generated files are kept here for interest and to allow easy diffs. I hope to share the rest of the generation configuration soon.

If you've been involved in a TestLab, please feel free to edit a .md file, and send a pull request.

I'll update this as I work. You'll find the site at [testlab.site](http://testlab.site).
