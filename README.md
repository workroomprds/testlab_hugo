hugo for TestLab site

I think that we need a public page for the TestLab.

So this is the source.

We're using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io "Hugo :: A fast and modern static website engine") to generate a static site from markdown.

The markdown files are under change control, and are kept here. I hope to share the rest of the generation code soon.

If you've been involved in a TestLab, please clone, edit and send a pull request.

I'll work on this, and will update the site as I go.
