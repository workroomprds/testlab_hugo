<p>Yes, you can.</p>

<h1 id="get-involved:980cf86e6c30efa1e296b8548b376abf">Get Involved</h1>

<p>We need people to organise, to set up, to greet and involve participants. Contact anyone on the list who is running an event soon. Or get in touch with James or Bart and we&rsquo;ll keep you in mind.</p>

<h1 id="we-ll-test-your-software:980cf86e6c30efa1e296b8548b376abf">We&rsquo;ll test your Software</h1>

<p>If you make open-source software, we&rsquo;re always on the hunt for new stuff to test. We hope you&rsquo;ll have a relativly-mature product without obvious bugs that works on a range of devices – but you won&rsquo;t have to meet all those requirements. We&rsquo;ll give you good feedback, and will try to get you into the lab so you can see how testers are testing.</p>

<h1 id="present-to-our-participants:980cf86e6c30efa1e296b8548b376abf">Present to our Participants</h1>

<p>We try to make the TestLab available to speakers, so that they can get people doing things that they&rsquo;d otherwise be hearing about. We&rsquo;ve taken the TestLab into sessions, and speakers have lead their participants from the session rooms into the TestLab. More commonly, we schedule a hands-on session for speakers to run themselves in the TestLab. We publicise these. Sessions before your lecture can attract people to the lecture. Sessions after can help interested participants to deepen their understanding.</p>

<h1 id="lend-us-your-kit:980cf86e6c30efa1e296b8548b376abf">Lend us your Kit</h1>

<p>Typically, client devices and networking kit. You&rsquo;ll need to lend it to us for the duration of the event – and you may need to give us the admin passwords so we can install stuff. We&rsquo;ll try not to break it, and you may need to uninstall stuff when you get it back. It&rsquo;s a big ask, though we hjave regular kit donors. We&rsquo;ll get your name on the TestLab somehow.</p>

<h1 id="show-off-your-products:980cf86e6c30efa1e296b8548b376abf">Show off your Products</h1>

<p>The TestLab is a great place to demonstrate tools and techniques. Some conferences give expo-floor vendors an opportunity to show off their offering in action against TestLab software. Can your products be used outside the booth, against real software? Can your staff build enhance the testing that&rsquo;s going on through the event? It&rsquo;s an acid test, and only the most-confident vendors take us up&hellip; and attendees know that.</p>
